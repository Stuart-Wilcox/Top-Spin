# Top-Spin
###A puzzle board game created for CS1037
#### The premise of the game is
fairly simple, you have a circular chain of numbers in some non sorted order.By preforming one of 3
moves you need to place the numbers into order.
####The three possible moves are:
####1. Shifting the chain to the left
####2. Shifting the chain to the right
####3. Spinning the top
####When we spin the top we are placing a subset of 4 numbers into the chain but in reverse order. When
we shift left or right we only affect which numbers are available to spin.
